{-|
A data type of binary trees, HTree a, where each node
carries an int (representing frequency counts) and and leaves carry an
additional piece of data of type a (e.g. a char). A HTree is a Huffman
Tree. In a leaf node, (Leaf i c), i will represent the frequency of
occurence of c. In a branch node (Branch i l r), i will represent the
combined frquencies of the left and right children.

either is a Leaf or a Branch).

1. Complete the `ftable` function which constructs the sorted
   frequency table for the input `[a]`.
-}

fTable :: Ord a => [a] -> FreqTable a
fTable = undefined

{-|
2. Complete the `insert` function, which inserts a `HTree` node into a
   list sorted by ascending frequency.
-}

insert :: HTree a -> [HTree a] -> [HTree a]
insert h hs = undefined

{-|
3. Merge a list of `HTree` nodes into a single `Maybe HTree`. If the input
is empty, return `Nothing`. If the input contains a single element, we
are done. Otherwise, do the following: 
    * create a `Branch` node from the first two elements in the input,
	* use your `insert` function to insert this new
      element in the right place in the new list, which is formed of the old 
      list without its first two elements,
    * call `merge` recursively on the new list.


When merging two nodes, `n1` and `n2`, the node with the lowest frequency
will be the left-hand child in the new `Branch` node.
-}

merge :: [HTree a] -> Maybe (HTree a)
merge hs       = undefined

{-|
4. Complete the `tree` function, which constructs the Huffman tree for
the input `[a]`. Return `Nothing` if the input is empty.  Otherwise, do
the following: 
    * construct the frequency table for `str`,
	* use the frequency table to create a list of Leaf nodes, 
	* merge that list into a single tree by calling your `merge`
      function.

tree :: Ord a => [a] -> Maybe (HTree a)
tree str = undefined

{-|
5. Complete the `generateCode` function, which retrieves the code
   embodied by a Huffman tree. The function returns a `HCode`, which
   is a lookup table of `Code` values, each of which is a `Path` from
   the root to one of the leaves of the tree, indexed by the value
   that is found at the leaf.
-}

generateCode :: Ord a => HTree a -> HCode a
generateCode t     = undefined

{-|
6. Complete the `encode` function, which creates the tree for the
   input, `str`, generates the code for that tree, and uses it to
   encode `str`. It returns a pair of the encoded input and the HCode
used to encode it.
-}

encode :: Ord a => [a] -> Maybe (HEncoded a)
encode str = undefined

{-|
7. Complete the `decode` function, which takes some encoded input and
   a `HCode` object and returns the decoded result.
